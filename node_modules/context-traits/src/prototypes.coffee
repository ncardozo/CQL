# A _context_ represents a situation that might arise during program
# execution, and which may affect the way the program behaves. This
# corresponds to the normal notion of context found in dictionaries
# such as
# [Merriam-Webster](http://merriam-webster.com/dictionary/context) and
# [Cambridge](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/context_1).

# An _adaptation_ represents the adaptation of an object to a
# particular context, as specified by a given trait. The trait
# contains properties that are specific to the context.
